# Master Theses at NTNU

This repository contains information about the Masters theses at NTNU.

A Latex template, class file, and examples for writing a Masters thesis at NTNU

You should fork the COPCSE repo so that you have your own files to edit.

You should not change anything in the ntnuthesis folder. That contains the structure and style information.

You should edit the files in the root folder, or make a new folder to include your own files. You can also add files in the figures\ folder. The Daimdata.tex will only be used if you are going to generate a file not in the DAIM system, thus this should be a copy of the data you are entering into the DAIM system.

If you are using sharelatex then you should use the New Project -> Import from GitHUB that way you will have the repository in both sharelatex and on your own version on github.
