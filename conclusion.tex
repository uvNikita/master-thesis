\begin{itemize}
    \item Overall image classification system performance depends on the initial requirements in terms of precision-recall rate. However, study showed that on the dataset used in the research, average precision of level X is achievable using state of the art methods.
    \item .. More complex images can lead to worse results
    \item Main challenges:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quality of the tags
        \item Context and vague labels
        \item Design of categories tree
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clear specification of terms
            \item Granularity of categories
        \end{itemize}
        \item Duplicates
        \item Amount and distribution of images
        \item Multi-label dataset split
    \end{itemize}
    \item Investments in dataset or network architecture or processing power
\end{itemize}
